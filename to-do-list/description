Hi.

I made this simple to-do list program by breaking down the problem of building a to-do list app that would allow users to add, edit and delete tasks, into smaller problems.
I decided to use an ordered list to display the tasks. 
I used Javascript functions to enable the add, edit and delete buttons.

Certain links I found useful while making this mini project:
